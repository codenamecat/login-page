# Login page
This is a part of a larger project, the mobile view for a magazine website login page. Due to the project being a part of something bigger, the links are mostly placeholders, 
and it's not possible to actually sign up or log in (though attempts will show the user a message about their success). I made this to have some practice with CSS animations. 
I kept them quite simple, the menus drop down smoothly and the logos do a little spin. I wanted them to be a little extra flavour, but not too distracting. 
Closing the menus happens instantly since that's what I'd prefer as a user. The project is also functional with keyboard only and images have alternative text.

Since this is mobile design only, it does not look its best on very large screens. I wanted to polish the mobile view rather than commit to more than I could realistically finish 
in the limited time I had.
